About Me
========

I'm Hunter and this is Hunter Software Consulting.  I'm an engineering leader with decades of experience, with successful exits from Silverpop, SalesLoft, Calendly, and Sendoso.  I've built and led teams from 1 to hundreds, and scaled products from 0 to hundreds of millions.  I've also been advising companies through ATV and ATDC.

After all these experiences, I've seen the same problems recur time and time again.
Most Series A startups hit the same wall: everyone’s busy, yet execution slows.

Pull requests languish. QA time balloons. Code that could be deployed in hours is released in months. “Quick” changes trigger months of rework and take weeks themselves. Timelines grow, and uncertainty explodes.I don’t believe most teams have a talent problem. They have a system problem and a strategy problem.

I work with Series A B2B SaaS Startups where engineering feels chaotic, frustrating, and stuck. My job is to be your objective operator - someone who supplies vision from leadership to release, surfaces the real bottlenecks, and provides you with a to ship and sell.
