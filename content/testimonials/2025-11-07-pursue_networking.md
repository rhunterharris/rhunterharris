Hunter is in the elite category of advisors I’ve worked with, and for good reason. He’s incredibly technically savvy, with deep expertise in AI, back-end architecture, and managing development processes.

Hunter has worked on major technical applications and speaks from real authority, which has helped me better understand how these systems even work at scale.

What makes Hunter truly unique is his ability to communicate complex technical ideas in a way that someone like me — a non-technical founder — can easily grasp.  That combination of knowledge and clarity is rare, and it’s been valuable for me.

Beyond his technical expertise, Hunter went above and beyond.  He met with me outside of the advisor hours, provided proactive feedback on my Chrome Extension, offered UI support, and even connected me to people in his network to help solve my challenges.
