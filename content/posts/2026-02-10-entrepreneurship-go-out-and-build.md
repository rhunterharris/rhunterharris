Do you have an idea for an app?  For a website?  For a chrome extension? For a solution to a problem?

## Go and build it!  Today!

This moment, now, is unprecedented in human history.  We have incredible creative technology, which makes computer use significantly easier.  It's subsidized to a level that I don't believe we've seen before.  It's accessible for literal dollars.

If you have an idea, just go and build it, or some piece of it.

Don't worry if it's crap.
Don't worry if it doesn't work well.
Don't worry if it isn't perfect.

Build it and show it to someone, and get feedback.  Don't be discouraged if the feedback is negative, just address the feedback.  And ask if they'd pay for it (even if that number is 0)!

## Do it again, and again, and again.

If multiple people complain about something, fix it.  If not, don't.

Keep at it.  Charge money for it.

# Learn. Build. Grow.

Codex.  Cursor.  Claude Code.

Loveable.  Bubble.  Bolt.  Replit.

The tools don't matter - what matters is action.  These tools are imminently usable.  Yes, there are sharp edges, dead ends, and problems.  The great thing is - you can use these tools to accelerate your learning, and use them to file down edges, back out of dead ends, and solve problems.

- Start solely by vibing - just work with the material and worry about quality when you have customers.
- Next, start breaking into the code bit by bit.  Ask the agent to explain why it did things.  Challenge it.  Discuss with it.  Push back on it.
- Talk to others in your community.  Fellow entrepreneurs may have tips and tricks (don't just pay for a course), connect with a community that supports you, and support them in turn.
- Build in public.  Show what you've built.  Be proud of it, even if it's small and ugly.

Just keep building, bit by bit.  You can do it.
